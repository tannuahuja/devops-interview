1.--------Resource sharing : how to allocate resources btw multiple development teams
u have multiple microservices deployed on same k8s cluster. For that create diff namespaces for each microservice.
but issue comes if any service is taking more memory than needed in that case memory leak issue is there : OOM killed 
for each namespace we have to set the resource quota limit. so namespace will use only provided RAM and CPU
>>> for this ask for development team to give an idea how much RAM and CPU is needed.Do performance benchmarking with the team

Resource quota is set on particular namespace : to prevent memory leak on whole cluster
Resource limit is set on particular pod : to prevent memory leak on namespace

if we do not set resouce limit one pod will get all the memory and cpu in the namespace and for other it is not available.


2. -------OOM killed issues with pod : crashLoopBackOffError

3.-------Upgrades : kubeadm or EKS
before that create a detailed manual on explaining how to take backup, release notes, how to upgrade control plane and worker node components
 for worker nodes : first drain the nodes eans give time to move the pods to another node, once node is empty then make the node unscheduled
then upgrade the kubelet to the new version and then make the node active again but scheduling.
